## Course Description

Advanced course on biostatistics focused on combining data with models to generate mechanistic descriptions of biological patterns. Building from simple linear regression, the course teaches regression methods for handling the most routinely encountered features in biological data. Emphasis is placed on understanding and interpreting the analyses in biological terms and linking analyses to theoretical or applied questions. The course is divided into core lectures and practicals.

## Course Objectives

This course combines lectures on theory and concepts with time practicing statistical tools in `R` based software packages. The course is designed to equip students with the tools and knowledge they need to perform a variety of regression-based analyses that can model common features of biological data. For each topic, there will be a core lecture module and a lab based practical module. With the lectures, students will learn the theory behind core modelling tools including multiple linear regression, mixed effects models, generalised linear models, and generalised least squares, while the lab modules are intended to provide a pathway that students can follow over the longer term as their skills develop. 


Learning Outcomes:
*	Fit regression models via maximum likelihood
*	Interpret residuals to assess/improve a modelâ€™s fit
*	Fit models with fixed and random effects
*	Fit models with non-Gaussian error distributions
*	Fit non-linear models
*	Handle non-independence in data, including phylogenetic inertia and temporal/spatial autocorrelation
*	Perform AIC-based model selection
*	Build models to simulate data and conduct power analyses
*	Link questions, analyses, and studying design
